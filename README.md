# DVD Screensaver Simulator
This is a JavaScript-based DVD screensaver simulator that I created using only raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The simulator mimics the behavior of the classic DVD screensaver, where a bouncing DVD logo moves around the screen and bounces off the edges.

To create this project, I used HTML to create the basic structure of the webpage, CSS to style the layout and design, and JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to the project. Specifically, I used JavaScript to animate the DVD logo and detect collisions with the edges of the screen, causing the logo to bounce off in a new direction.

I chose to create this project using only raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a way to challenge myself and deepen my understanding of these technologies. I found it to be a fun and rewarding project that allowed me to improve my coding skills and creativity.

Overall, this DVD screensaver simulator is a fun and nostalgic project that can be enjoyed by anyone looking to relive the glory days of the classic DVD screensaver. Feel free to check out the code and play around with it yourself!
